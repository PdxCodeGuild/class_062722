          *PLEASE NOTE: Snacks options will be available; however, campers are
          welcome to bring their own snack that does not require refrigeration.
          Please bring a water bottle with your child's name on it, there will
          be water available to refill their bottles. If your child will be
          attending both the morning and the afternoon camp sessions, please
          send them with a packed lunch. All participants for summer camp are
          encouraged to bring sunscreen each day. We will offer water play days
          once or twice a week. Campers are asked to bring a towel on water play
          days and may bring/wear a swimsuit. You will receive an email prior to
          your camp enrollment with important information, including which days
          we will have water play.
