# Version 1 
    # using given list for nums = [5, ,0, 8, 3, 4, 1, 6]
    # thoughts are to run some loops and print sum functions with some math going on
    # i will try to define a function that will do this stuff and use that for version 2

numbahs = [5, 0, 8, 3, 4, 1, 6]
print(numbahs)
print('\n') # trying to make this a little easier to identify

for numbah in numbahs:
    print(numbah)
print('\n') # trying to make this a little easier to identify

for i in range(len(numbahs)):
    print(numbahs[i])
print('\n') # trying to make this a little easier to identify
print(sum(numbahs)/len(numbahs))
