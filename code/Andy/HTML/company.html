                        A holistic lifestyle is a way of living life that lets you look at the big picture - the whole person. I like to think of holistic as being connected to a wholeness. You don't try to make your life better by focusing on one thing like eating well, personal growth, spirituality, or creating contributions.

     <!-- Notes:
        .bg is background gradient
        .look at break points in bootstrap when dealing with expand and size like lg md 
        .on line 16 cant just write what you want in the class because it specifics shit. or it'll go blue, needs to be brand so it can be put as a header i guess?
        .a. is an a tag. 
        ,the expand in line 13 makes it so when you move the screen it fixes the text Home Products Contact
        .ms is margin start and auto is to the left, has to be in the ul to be able to move all of it 
        .span is used for grouping elements for styling 
        .the target get namenu and goes to the id where navmenu is and puts the button to where it collapas
        .section html for a standalone element
        .container does what it says contains shit with in a box or something 
        .class =img-fluid bounds an image within its container and doesnt have that weird ass border
        .w-50 is the wideth so making it half the size
        .d-flex means using it on all sizes but putting d-sm-flex. by adding the breakpoint sm it allows flex to be enabled when it breaks out of the sm so its able to be used on phones
        .my is margin on the y axis mx would be the inverse
