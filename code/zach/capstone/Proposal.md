# Project Overview
The major features of the web application will be to create/authenticate users and provide them a list of three options based on their disire. The UI will change the color palette of the site as well as filter the grid to people searching for the same thing i.e. looking to make friends. Users will be able to view the grid based on distance and filter based on profile attributes. Additionally the users can view profiles of other users and send messages.
The problem the app is attempting to address is providing all basic features for free to users instead of using a predatory model like some existing apps to maximize their bottom line. Apps like Grindr have gone from $0.99 a month for a subscription to $40 a month just to get some more advanced filtering and viewing more profiles. 

## Functionality
A new user will hit the landing page and be prompted to sign in or register. The registration will walk them through creating a username and password, completing basic information to load into their profile, and upload pictures. Once completed the user will submit and be routed to the home page where a grid of other users is displayed based on location in proximity to the logged in user. The default mode will be set to Friends for first time users and allow them to change to either Dates or Hookups. Based on the selected mode, the UI will change the color palette to the respective mode following color theory for each mode's intent. From here users can select and interact with the profiles of other users.
