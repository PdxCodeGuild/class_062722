    <h3>Who is Benjamin Franklin?</h3>

    <p>
      Benjamin Franklin was an American polymath who was active as a writer,
      scientist, inventor, statesman, 'diplomat, printer, publisher, and
      political philosopher. Among the leading intellectuals of his time,
      Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, a drafter
      and signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and the first
      United States Postmaster General.

      As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American Enlightenment and
      the history of physics for his studies of electricity, and for charting
      and naming the current still known as the Gulf Stream. As an inventor, he
      is known for the lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove, among
      others. He founded many civic organizations, including the Library
      Company, Philadelphia's first fire department, and the University of
      Pennsylvania. Franklin earned the title of "The First American" for his
      early and indefatigable campaigning for colonial unity, and as an author
      and spokesman in London for several colonies. As the first United States
      ambassador to France, he exemplified the emerging American nation.
      Franklin was foundational in defining the American ethos as a marriage of
      the practical values of thrift, hard work, education, community spirit,
      self-governing institutions, and opposition to authoritarianism both
      political and religious, with the scientific and tolerant values of the
      Enlightenment. In the words of historian Henry Steele Commager, "In
      Franklin could be merged the virtues of Puritanism without its defects,
      the illumination of the Enlightenment without its heat." Franklin has been
      called "the most accomplished American of his age and the most influential
      in inventing the type of society America would become."
