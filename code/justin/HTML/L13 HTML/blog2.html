    <div>No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. Chicken fingers… with spicy club sauce. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. She calls it a Mayonegg. Don't ask "Can I"… ask "I Can!" I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block! This is not what it looks like. It looks like you're tweaking her nipples through a chain-link fence. You stay on top of her, Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard.

        The only thing more terrifying than the escaped lunatic's hook was his twisted call… Hey campers! No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist.
        
        Oh, hi, Mom. I have the afternoon free. Really? Did "nothing" cancel? Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! Go ahead, touch the cornballer. Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. A trick is something a whore does for money… or cocaine.
        
        It's a wonderful restaurant! Heyyyy uncle father Oscar. Family Love Michael. How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces. I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had.
        
        I hear the jury's still out on science. You burn down the storage unit? Oh, most definitely. Friend of mine from college. He also has a boat tho not called the Seaward. Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. But anyhoo, can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood?
        
        ¡Soy loco por los Cornballs! Speaking of settling, how's Ann? Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. Maybe it was the eleven months he spent in the womb. The doctor said there were claw marks on the walls of her uterus. Well, OK, have sex with this girl. Right now. Get in there, have some sex with her. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. They frame my junk.
        
        Say goodbye to THESE! I cheated and I lied and I whored around. I guess you can say I'm buy-curious.
        
        Heyyyyyy, Uncle Father Oscar. Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you.
        
        Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. The Man Inside Me seems well reviewed. I don't want no part of yo' tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings. Queens. The King of Queens. For there's a man inside me, and only when he's finally out, can I walk free of pain. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. I thought the two of us could talk man-on-man.
        
        Get rid of the Seaward. Lucille: I'll leave when I'm good and ready. Family Love Michael. Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. Even though sooooo many people in this office are begging for it. </div>
