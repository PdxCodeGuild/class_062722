# Create A Lab Branch

## Notes and Assumptions
* When some text below is placed between `<` and `>`, that means the user should provide their own text in the command and the user should not include the `<` and `>`.
    * Example (for [Lab 0: Getting Started](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/class_062722/blob/main/0%20General/00%20Getting%20Started)):
        * studentname: `bruce`
        * labnumber: `lab00`
        * lab-name: `getting-started`
        * The branch would be `bruce-lab00-getting-started`.

## Objectives

## Process

1. Open CLI

1. `cd` into repository (if not already there). Don't have to be in root of repository:  

1. Check status of repository:  
    `git status`
    * Sample code:  
    ```

    ```

1. Checkout local `main` `branch`:  
    `git checkout main`
    * Sample code:  
    ```

    ```

1. `pull` recent commits of remote `main` branch to local `main` branch:  
    `git pull`
    * Sample code:  
    ```

    ```

1. Create and checkout a lab local `branch` from local `main`:  
    `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`
    * Sample code:  
    ```

    ```
