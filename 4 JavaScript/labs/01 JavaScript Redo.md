# Lab 1: JavaScript Redo

## Version 1

Pick a Python lab and re-do it in JavaScript. You should first try to write them using JavaScript's `prompt` and `alert` in place of Python's `input` and `print`.

### Possible lab choices, among others
- [Lab 01: Average Numbers](../../1%20Python/labs/01%20Average%20Numbers.md)
- [Lab 02: Unit Converter](../../1%20Python/labs/02%20Unit%20Converter.md)
- [Lab 03: Number to Phrase](../../1%20Python/labs/03%20Number%20To%20Phrases.md)
- [Lab 04: Blackjack Advice](../../1%20Python/labs/04%20Black%20Jack%20Advice.md)
- [Lab 05: Pick6](../..//1%20Python/labs/05%20Pick6.md)
- [Lab 06: Make Change](../../1%20Python/labs/06%20Make%20Change.md)
- [Lab 07: Credit Card Validation](../../1%20Python/labs/07%20Credit%20Card%20Validation.md)

## Version 2 (optional)

Once you have that working, use `input` and `button` elements, with events. You can read the docs on **DOM Manipulation** and **Events**. You can view a demo [DOM Interaction Demo - codepen.io](https://codepen.io/flux2341/pen/rJpBXe?editors=1010).
